title: Ray and Kubernetes Backend
description: Run the same training script on Ray, or let Kubernetes schedule every worker of the run.
---
Miles runs a job on one of two cluster backends. Ray is the default and needs no configuration.
Kubernetes installs the run as a helm release, so the cluster schedules every worker. The training
script is the same either way.

<Warning>

**Status.** Under active development: flags, chart values and failure semantics still change. Ray
also runs *inside* Kubernetes, and that is the well-trodden path — take this one only if you want
Miles to create the cluster's objects itself.

</Warning>

## Launch

Run everything from the repository root, with `kubectl` and `helm` on your PATH.

Install a workbench — the long-lived pod you launch from — once per namespace, from your
cluster's [`infra.yaml`](#for-cluster-administrator):

```bash
export MILES_NS="miles-$USER"
python -m miles.utils.external_utils.miles_workbench install -n "$MILES_NS" -f infra.yaml
```

It creates the namespace if missing, checks your rights, installs, and waits for Ready. Runs
launched from the pod inherit those values.

Launch from inside it:

```bash
python -m miles.utils.external_utils.miles_workbench exec -n "$MILES_NS" -- \
  bash -lc "cd /root/miles && python scripts/run_qwen3_4b.py train"
```

## Worker communication

The cluster backend says who *creates* a worker. `--worker-comm-backend` says how the driver *calls*
it, and the two are separate choices.

- `ray` — the driver holds an actor handle and calls the worker as a Ray actor method.
- `rpc` — every worker serves an HTTP server, and the driver calls it through a typed client.
- unset (the default) — the cluster backend picks: `ray` under `--cluster-backend ray`, `rpc` under
  `--cluster-backend kubernetes`, which has no actors to call.

Both modes coexist under the Ray backend, and the plan is to flip the default to `rpc` once it has
run long enough in production; the `ray` path is removed only after that.

Under `--cluster-backend ray --worker-comm-backend rpc`:

- Each served worker is built inside a `ServeActor` — a Ray actor running the RPC server in its own
  process, so RDT and everything else in the Ray ecosystem still sees the worker.
- The RPC port is allocated by the same dynamic port allocator the rest of the Ray path uses.
- If the server ever stops serving, the actor exits, so a worker nobody can call is never reported
  alive.
- SGLang engines and routers are launched by `CommandActor` and are unaffected.

### What a worker's methods have to look like

The RPC layer builds its client from the worker class, so every public method of a served worker is
part of the wire contract:

- Annotate every parameter and the return type. An unannotated public method makes the whole pool
  unreachable, and the error names the method.
- Use types the wire can carry: pydantic models, dataclasses, enums, and the plain built-ins.
- Make a method private when it never crosses the wire. That is the cheap answer to "what wire type
  does this argument even have".
- Never answer `dict`, `Any` or an untyped container from a method that carries an object store
  reference. `Any` is not rebuilt on the way in, so a `StoreObjectRef` arrives as a plain mapping,
  nobody can free the object it points at, and the store fills up over a long run. Declare a model
  instead — `RolloutDataPack` is what a rollout answers, `TrainStepOutput` what a train step does.

One exception exists. `Pickled`, from `miles.utils.workers.rpc.common.wire_types`, sends a
parameter as pickle bytes:

- It is applied to exactly one parameter — the argparse `args` namespace a trainer is built from —
  because nothing else reproduces it losslessly, and Megatron reads hundreds of fields off it.
- It is per parameter. Every other argument of the same call stays strictly wire-typed.
- It is temporary. Once the arguments subsystem is split into wire-typed pieces, the hatch is
  removed; grep `MILES_PICKLED_HATCH` to find it.
- `tests/fast/utils/workers/test_pickled_hatch_boundary.py` fails if anything else on the wire
  reaches for it — a parameter, a return annotation, or a field of a wire model. It reads the whole
  annotation, so a union, a container, an import alias, a module-level alias and a quoted forward
  reference are all caught. Prefer `WireNamespace`, which carries a
  namespace as plain json, when the fields are simple enough to survive it.

### How long a call may take, and what a timeout means

- Every RPC call has a client-side deadline (`DEFAULT_CALL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, one hour). Under
  `--worker-comm-backend ray` there is no such deadline: a slow call is simply slow.
- A timeout is the client giving up on polling. It does not, by itself, stop the worker: a sync
  method already running in its executor thread cannot be interrupted from outside.
- So the client tells the server before it gives up. `DELETE /v1/calls/{call_id}` marks the call
  abandoned; an async method is cancelled outright, and a sync one that has not left the queue never
  starts.
- While an abandoned call may still be running, a new call to the *same* method is refused with
  `409`. That is what keeps fault tolerance from retrying a `train` step beside the one it replaced
  and interleaving two optimizer steps in one process. Other methods stay callable, and the refusal
  ends when the abandoned call does.
- A failure that happens after the worker method already ran — encoding the result on the server,
  decoding it on the client — is reported as non-retryable, because retrying it would run the body
  twice.

## Where Ray communication is still allowed

Ray is the launcher, so Ray calls are confined to the launcher's own closure. Everything else must
be reachable over RPC.

| Area | Ray allowed | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RayWorkerManager`, worker provider, cell operations, `CommandActor`, port allocator | yes | the launcher talking to itself, the same way Kubernetes talks to the kube API |
| Ray object store (`StoreObjectRef`) | yes | a data plane of its own: under `rpc` the reference travels as `ray.cloudpickle` bytes, which pins the object, so `remove` frees it explicitly |
| Dashboard collector, prometheus collector | yes, as known debt | named actors with no Kubernetes form; prometheus is skipped there |
| multi-LoRA controller | no | already an independent worker, called through a worker handle |
| Everything else, including every worker method | no | `tests/fast/utils/workers/test_ray_communication_boundary.py` fails on a new `import ray` |

The check reads every shipped module — `miles/`, `miles_plugins/`, `scripts/`, `examples/`, `tools/` and the
orchestration scripts at the repository root, with only `tests/` out of scope — because the driver is where
a Ray-only `except` clause hides most easily. `import ray`, `import ray.exceptions`, `import ray as r`,
`from ray.… import …` and `importlib.import_module("ray")` all count, and every exemption carries the reason
it belongs to the launcher closure.

`remove` destroys rather than decrements: a freed object is gone for every holder. So only a reference this
process itself materialized from the wire is freed — that is the one whose reference count no longer
protects it. Each reference remembers that on itself, so the bookkeeping is freed with the reference rather
than growing for the life of the process. Under `--worker-comm-backend ray` a reference is passed through untouched and `remove` leaves
it to Ray's own reference counting.

## Observability

**Built in**

- The launcher follows every pod's logs, prints status changes and warning events, and ends with
  the run's exit code.
- On a failure, collect the namespace's logs, describes and events into one directory — before
  cleaning up, and the whole namespace, because the explanation is usually the pod next to it:
  `python -m miles.utils.external_utils.miles_workbench collect-diagnosis -n "$MILES_NS" --output-dir ~/artifacts/miles`

**External**

- A run's pods are ordinary pods, so whatever the cluster already runs — a metrics stack, a log
  collector, the platform's own dashboards — sees them with no wiring from Miles.
- Prefer it at scale. The built-in following is meant for watching one run, not hundreds of pods.

## Clean up

```bash
python -m miles.utils.external_utils.miles_workbench stop -n "$MILES_NS" 260811-143000-042
python -m miles.utils.external_utils.miles_workbench uninstall -n "$MILES_NS"
```

`stop` removes the run and frees its GPUs; `uninstall` removes the workbench.

## Folder convention

A run is many pods on many machines, and they share nothing but the storage `infra.yaml` mounts.
A path that is not on it is the most common way a run fails.

- Every path your script names — `/root/models`, `/root/datasets` — has to be on it.
- Copying a file into a pod is pointless: pods come and go, the mount survives.
- To run your own branch instead of the image's copy, name its sub-path under the storage root:
  `infra.paths.repos.miles: alice/miles`. `megatron` and `sglang` work the same way.

## For cluster administrator

Everything above assumes this was done once.

**Install LWS.** Miles deploys its worker pools as
[LeaderWorkerSets](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/lws). Install the CRDs and controller, and
grant users rights over them explicitly: LWS ships no aggregation labels, so a namespace `admin`
role does not include them.

**Give each user a namespace.** The namespace is the real boundary, not the Role: anything that
may create workloads can name another ServiceAccount and read its token. Keep privileged accounts
out of it.

**Write one `infra.yaml`.** The same file drives every Miles chart:

```yaml
infra:
  image:
    repository: radixark/miles
    tag: dev
  sharedStorage:
    type: hostPath
    hostPath: /cluster-storage
    mountPath: /cluster-storage
```

`charts/miles-run/values.yaml` shows the full shape, and each chart's `values.schema.json` is the
authoritative field list.
